---- This project was realized during classes in Polytech Tours french school ----

IDMTrafSim provides an implementation of the Intelligent Driver Model. You can found some description about this mathematics model here : 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_driver_model.
 
It includes manual append of cars and three traffic lights. You can also start/stop and pause/resume the simulation.

Things to know :
     - if a collision appends, the car will come back to the beginning of the road
     - a traffic light is managed as a stopped car

You can contact me if you have any problem or question.
